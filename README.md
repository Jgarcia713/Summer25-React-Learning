A collection of small projects I did in order to learn React.  
It features: 
1. A classic task list webapp
2. A notes app that connects to Supabase to store notes
3. An app that experiments with log in pages using routers and authentication through Supabase
4. A prompt debugging application where you submit a prompt and an LLM (OpenAI API) critiques it and breaks down how the prompt is interpretted
